# Sensorize_server
A Java application that acts as a server for the android app "Sensorize" (konkall/Sensorize_androidApp repo) that was developed as an assignment for the DIT course "Software development for Networks and Telecommunications".

In this assignment we developed a Java application that collects data from the android app "Sensorize", calculates based on that data if two users are about to collide and notifies them.
